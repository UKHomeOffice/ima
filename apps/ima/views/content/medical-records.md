We may need access to your immigration removal centre medical records, to make a decision on your claim.

<span class="medical-paragraph">This may include information about:</span>
- medical conditions you have
- medication you are taking or treatment you are receiving
- your health
<br>
<br>

You do not have to agree to give the Home Office this information, but it would help us to fully consider any medical conditions which may affect you.
